Lab 3.1: Install and Configure Jenkins

      This section will guide you to: 
Install and run Jenkins
      This lab has 4 subsections:
3.2.1	Add a key to use Debian repository.
3.2.2	Make changes to /etc/opt/sources.list.
3.2.3	Update local package index.
3.2.4	Run Jenkins in browser.
       
Go to https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/ to understand how to install Jenkins on a Ubuntu/Debian machine.
Step 3.2.1 : To use the Debian repository of Jenkins to automate installation and upgrade, first add the key to your system using the following command:
 wget -q -O – https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add –

Step 3.2.2 : Then, add the following entry in your /etc/apt/sources.list:
 sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list
      Now add the following command:
        deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/
      Save and exit using :wq!
      Step 3.2.3 : Update your local package index.
       sudo apt-get update
      Make sure you have jdk installed. If not, install it using the following command:
      sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
      Then install Jenkins.
      sudo apt-get install jenkins
      Step 3.2.4 : Once Jenkins is installed, open a browser on your local machine and enter the
      URL:    x.x.x.x:8080
      replacing x.x.x.x with the external IP address of your virtual machine.
      You will need to enter the admin password.
      To find the password, type the following command:
      sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
      Use the string of numbers as password. Once you are logged in, you will be redirected to the page below:
 
      Select Install suggested plugins. You will be redirected to the page below:
 
After installing recommended plugins, you can create “First Admin User” or continue as Admin by filling the required details as shown in the screenshot.
 

Once that is done, start using Jenkins.
